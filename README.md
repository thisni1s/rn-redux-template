# React-Native Reux Template

This is a ready to go react native setup that includes a very opinionated redux setup using redux-thunk and redux-persist with the AsyncStorage and SensitiveStorage engines. 

New Reducers or thunks can be added via a yarn script like this:

`yarn new <reducer|thunk> <object|array> <name>`
